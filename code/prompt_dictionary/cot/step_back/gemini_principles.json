            "question": "A rock drops onto a pond with a smooth surface. A few moments later, the wave produced by the rock\u2019s impact arrives at the shore, touching the ankles of a wading child. Which of the following observations provides evidence that the portion of the wave hitting the child\u2019s ankles carries less energy than the wave did when it was first created by the rock\u2019s impact?",
            "principles": "## Principles Involved:\n\n1. **Wave Energy:** The energy carried by a wave is related to its amplitude. Larger amplitude waves carry more energy.\n\n2. **Wave Propagation:** Waves lose energy as they travel through a medium due to factors like friction, absorption, and spreading out. \n\n3. **Wave Attenuation:** This is the process of wave energy decreasing as the wave propagates. It is often expressed as a decrease in amplitude.\n\n4. **Wave Interference:** Waves can interfere with each other, resulting in constructive or destructive interference. While not directly relevant to this problem, it's a general principle of wave behavior.\n\n5. **Conservation of Energy:** Although energy is lost through attenuation, it is not destroyed. The energy is transferred to other forms, such as heat or sound, within the medium.\n\n6. **Observation and Interpretation:** The question asks for evidence based on observation, meaning the principles above must be applied to observable features of the wave. \n\nThese principles and concepts form the basis for understanding the energy transfer and propagation of waves, particularly in the context of a wave's journey from its source to a distant point.  \n"

            "question": "Physics students are checking the constant acceleration equations of kinematics by measuring the velocity of a tennis ball that is dropped and falls 6 meters and then passes through a photogate. The predicted velocity is 20% above the velocity measured by the photogate. Which of the following best describes the cause of the large percent difference?",
            "principles": "The principles involved in this problem stem from kinematics, specifically dealing with free-fall motion under constant acceleration due to gravity. Here's a breakdown:\n\n**1. Kinematic Equations:**\n\n* **Constant Acceleration Equations:** These equations relate displacement (d), initial velocity (v\u2080), final velocity (v), acceleration (a), and time (t) for motion under constant acceleration. The relevant equations here are:\n\n    *  **v\u00b2 = v\u2080\u00b2 + 2ad**  (This equation directly relates final velocity, initial velocity, acceleration, and displacement) \n    * **v = v\u2080 + at**  (This equation relates final velocity, initial velocity, acceleration, and time)\n\n* **Free Fall:** In the case of a falling object, the acceleration is due to gravity (g), which is approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2.  \n\n**2. Experimental Error Analysis:**\n\n* **Sources of Error:** It's important to understand potential sources of error in the experiment. These can include:\n\n    * **Measurement Errors:** Inaccuracies in measuring the distance (6 meters) or the time taken for the ball to pass through the photogate.\n    * **Air Resistance:** Neglecting air resistance, which can significantly affect the velocity of a falling object, especially at higher speeds.\n    * **Photogate Response Time:** The photogate itself might not have an instantaneous response time, leading to a slight delay in measuring the velocity. \n\n**3. Percentage Difference:**\n\n* **Calculating Percentage Difference:**  The percentage difference is calculated to quantify the discrepancy between the predicted and measured values.  It's calculated as:\n\n     * (|(Predicted Value - Measured Value)| / Measured Value) * 100%\n\n**4.  Interpreting the Percentage Difference:**\n\n* **Significant Difference:** A large percentage difference (20% in this case) suggests a significant discrepancy between the theoretical prediction and the experimental results.  This indicates that one or more of the potential sources of error listed above are likely playing a significant role.\n"

            "principles": "## Principles Involved:\n\n1. **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n   T\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3 \n   where T is the orbital period and a is the semi-major axis (which is approximately the average distance from the sun for an elliptical orbit).\n\n2. **Relationship between Orbital Period and Distance:** This principle is derived from Kepler's Third Law.  It allows us to compare the orbital periods of two planets and their distances from the sun. Since we know the orbital period of Mercury and Earth, and the distance between Earth and the Sun (1 AU), we can use this relationship to calculate the distance between Mercury and the Sun.\n\n3. **Unit Conversion:** We may need to convert units of time (years to seconds) to use the equations derived from Kepler's Third Law consistently. \n\nThese principles and equations provide the framework for calculating the approximate distance between Mercury and the Sun, using the information provided about the orbital period of Mercury and the distance between Earth and the Sun. \n"

Given then the coefficient of friction between a person\u2019s clothing and the wall is \u03bc, the tangential speed is v, and the radius of the ride is R, what is greatest mass that a person can be to safely go on this ride?",
            "principles": "The physics principles behind this question involve forces, circular motion, and friction. Here are the relevant principles and equations:\n\n1. **Centripetal Force:**  An object moving in a circle experiences a force directed towards the center of the circle, keeping it on its circular path. This force is called centripetal force and is given by:\n   \n   ```\n   Fc = mv\u00b2/R \n   ```\n   Where:\n   * Fc is the centripetal force (in Newtons)\n   * m is the mass of the object (in kilograms)\n   * v is the tangential speed of the object (in meters per second)\n   * R is the radius of the circular path (in meters)\n\n2. **Friction:**  The force that opposes motion between two surfaces in contact. In this case, the friction between the person's clothing and the wall provides the centripetal force necessary to keep them from falling. \n\n   ```\n   Ff = \u03bc * Fn \n   ```\n   Where:\n   * Ff is the force of friction (in Newtons)\n   * \u03bc is the coefficient of friction \n   * Fn is the normal force (in Newtons)\n\n3. **Normal Force:**  The force exerted by a surface perpendicular to the object in contact with it. In this case, the normal force is equal to the force exerted by the wall on the person. This force is also equal to the person's weight:\n\n   ```\n   Fn = mg\n   ```\n   Where:\n   * Fn is the normal force (in Newtons)\n   * m is the mass of the person (in kilograms)\n   * g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2)\n\n4. **Free Body Diagram:**  A diagram showing all the forces acting on an object. In this problem, a free body diagram of the person would show the forces of gravity, normal force, and friction.\n\n5. **Newton's Second Law of Motion:** This law states that the net force acting on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration. In this problem, the net force acting on the person is the centripetal force.\n\n6. **Setting up the Equation:**  To determine the maximum mass a person can be, we will need to equate the centripetal force to the force of friction, and then solve for the mass (m). \n\nThese principles and equations are used to determine the maximum mass a person can be to safely go on the Gravitron ride, considering the tangential speed, radius, and coefficient of friction. \n"

            "question": "An artificial satellite orbits Earth just above the atmosphere in a circle with constant speed. A small meteor collides with the satellite at point P in its orbit, increasing its speed by 1%, but not changing the instantaneous direction of the satellite\u2019s velocity. Which of the following describes the satellite\u2019s new orbit?",
