            "solution": "The quantity that decreases as the inverse square of distance for distances far from the objects producing the fields is the intensity of the field. \n\nThe formula for the intensity of a field is given by:\nI = P/A \n\nwhere I is the intensity, P is the power or the total amount of energy transferred per unit time through the field, and A is the area over which the power is distributed.\n\nFor a field that is radiated isotropically (equally in all directions) from a point source, the intensity decreases as the inverse square of the distance from the source. This is because the power radiated by the source is spread out over a larger area as the distance increases, resulting in a decreased intensity.\n\nTherefore, the intensity is the quantity that decreases as the inverse square of the distance for distances far from the objects producing the fields."

Will the wavelength of the new standing waves be greater than or less than the wavelength of the original standing waves?",
            "solution": "To determine whether the wavelength of the new standing waves will be greater or less than the wavelength of the original standing waves, we need to consider the equation for the speed of a wave on a string:\n\nv = \u221a(T/\u03bc)\n\nWhere:\nv = speed of the wave\nT = tension in the string\n\u03bc = linear mass density of the string\n\nSince the length of the string is fixed, the frequency of the wave is determined solely by the tension in the string. When the tension in the string is increased, the speed of the wave will also change.\n\nSince the frequency of the wave remains constant at 100 Hz, and the speed of the wave depends on the tension in the string, the wavelength of the new standing waves will be greater than the wavelength of the original standing waves.\n\nTherefore, the wavelength of the new standing waves will be greater than the wavelength of the original standing waves."

The charge stored on the capacitor:\nIn a parallel circuit, the total charge stored on each capacitor is the same. This is because the capacitors are connected in parallel, allowing them to share the same voltage source. Therefore, the charge stored on each capacitor is the same.\n\nII. The voltage across the capacitor:\nIn a parallel circuit, the voltage across each capacitor is the same. This is because the voltage across each component in a parallel circuit is equal to the total voltage of the circuit. Therefore, the voltage across each capacitor is the same.\n\nIII. The capacitance of the capacitor:\nThe capacitance of the capacitors does not have to be the same in a parallel circuit. Capacitors in parallel add up in such a way that the total capacitance of the combination is equal to the sum of the individual capacitances.

Determine the relationship between the original amplitude and the new amplitude:\nWhen the mass on top of the original block is added, the amplitude of the oscillator will decrease because the system's total energy is now dissipated over a larger mass.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is: The new oscillation frequency will be lower than the original frequency, and the new amplitude will be smaller than the original amplitude."

Since the box is on a horizontal surface and the only vertical force is gravity, the normal force is equal to the weight of the box:\n\nN = mg\n\nThus, the force of kinetic friction is:\n\nf = \u03bcmg\n\nStep 4: Calculate the acceleration of the box.\n\nSubstitute the force of kinetic friction into the equation of motion:\n\n\u03bcmg = ma\n\nSolve for acceleration:\n\na = \u03bcg\n\nStep 5: Determine the distance the box slides before coming to rest.\n\nThe distance the box slides before coming to rest can be calculated using the equation of motion:\n\nv^2 = v_0^2 + 2a\u0394x\n\nwhere v is the final velocity of the box, v_0 is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and \u0394x is the distance the box slides.\n\nSince the final velocity is 0 (the box comes to rest), the equation becomes:\n\n0 = v_0^2 + 2a\u0394x\n\nSolve for \u0394x:\n\n\u0394x = -v_0^2 / (2a)\n\nSubstitute the values of v_0 and a into the equation:\n\n\u0394x = -v_0^2 / (2\u03bcg)\n\nTherefore, the box slides a distance of -v_0^2 / (2\u03bcg) before coming to rest."

We can also assume that the temperature T is the same for both gases since they have come to thermal equilibrium with the room.\n\nTherefore, the only variables that differ between the two gases are the pressure P and the number of moles of gas n. \n\nSince both containers are filled with the same amount of gas, we can assume that the number of moles of gas n is the same for both gases. This means that the only variable that can affect the pressure is the gas itself.\n\nHydrogen molecules are much lighter than nitrogen molecules. This means that hydrogen gas will have a higher average speed at the same temperature compared to nitrogen gas. According to the kinetic theory of gases, gas pressure is related to the average kinetic energy of gas particles.

            "solution": "The primary reason for the hot water and cold alcohol mixture reaching the same temperature is due to the process of thermal equilibrium. This occurs because heat naturally flows from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature until both regions reach the same temperature.\n\nIn this case, when the hot water is poured into the cold alcohol, the molecules of the hot water have a higher average kinetic energy compared to the molecules of the cold alcohol. As a result, heat energy is transferred from the hot water molecules to the cold alcohol molecules through collisions between the molecules.\n\nThe size of the molecules of the fluids is not the primary reason for this phenomenon. Rather, it is the difference in temperature between the two fluids that drives the heat transfer process until both reach thermal equilibrium.

Standing outside on a cold day: \nWhen a person is standing outside on a cold day, their body heat is slowly lost to the surrounding cold air through convection and radiation. The person's body is able to regulate its temperature by shivering to generate heat and by reducing blood flow to extremities to conserve heat. This process allows the person to withstand the cold temperatures for an extended period of time without ill effects.\n\n2. Falling into a cold lake:\nWhen a person falls into a cold lake, the body is suddenly exposed to a much colder medium than the air. Water has a much higher thermal conductivity than air, which means that heat is lost from the body at a much faster rate. In addition, water has a much higher heat capacity than air, so it can absorb a significant amount of heat from the body. This rapid heat loss can lead to hypothermia, where the body temperature drops to dangerously low levels. Hypothermia can quickly lead to loss of consciousness and death if not treated promptly.\n\nTherefore, the primary reason for the difference in effects between standing outside on a cold day and falling into a cold lake is the rapid heat loss and increased risk of hypothermia when submerged in water compared to exposure to cold air."

Identify the forces acting on the box. There are typically four forces to consider: gravity acting downwards (mg), the normal force acting perpendicular to the plane, the frictional force acting parallel to the plane, and the force applied on the box.\n3. Since the box is not sliding, the force of friction must be equal and opposite to the component of gravity parallel to the plane (Ffriction = \u00b5N, where \u00b5 is the coefficient of friction).\n4. As the angle of the plane increases, the component of gravity acting parallel to the plane also increases. This means that the normal force must also increase in order to balance the forces and prevent the box from sliding.\n5. Use trigonometry to determine the relationship between the angle of the plane and the normal force. The normal force (N) can be related to the force of gravity (mg) and the angle of the plane \u03b8 through the equation N = mg*cos(\u03b8).\n6. As the angle of the plane increases, the cosine of the angle decreases, which means that the normal force decreases.

If an object were dropped down that hole, which of the following would best describe its motion? Assume ideal conditions and that the object cannot be destroyed.",
            "solution": "First, we need to understand some basic principles of physics that will help us solve this problem.\n\n1. Gravitational force: The force of gravity pulls all objects towards the center of the Earth.\n\n2. Newton's laws of motion: According to Newton's first law, an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force. According to Newton's second law, the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.\n\nGiven these principles, let's analyze the motion of an object dropped down the hole through the center of the Earth.\n\n1. As the object is dropped down the hole, it will accelerate towards the center of the Earth due to the force of gravity. This acceleration will continue until the object reaches the center of the Earth.\n\n2. At the center of the Earth, the object will have reached its maximum speed and will momentarily come to a stop before starting to accelerate towards the other side of the Earth.\n\n3. As the object moves towards the other side of the Earth, it will start to slow down due to the gravitational force pulling it towards the center of the Earth from the opposite direction.\n\n4. The object will continue to decelerate until it reaches the other side of the Earth, where it will momentarily come to a stop before starting to accelerate back towards the center of the Earth.\n\n5. This cycle of acceleration, deceleration, and direction change will continue as the object moves back and forth between the two sides of the Earth.\n\nIn conclusion, the motion of an object dropped down a hole through the center of the Earth would be a repeated cycle of acceleration towards the center, coming to a stop, accelerating towards the other side, decelerating, and then repeating the process in the opposite direction."

When the second block falls on top and they stick together, their combined mass increases but their velocity decreases significantly due to the added mass.\n\nThe total energy of the system (spring-block oscillator + second block) before the collision is equal to the total energy after the collision. Since the total energy is conserved, the maximum potential energy reached during oscillations must remain the same even after the collision.\n\nTherefore, after the collision, the amplitude of the oscillations will decrease. This is because the maximum displacement from equilibrium position is directly related to the maximum potential energy reached during oscillations, which must be the same before and after the collision in a conserving system."

            "solution": "1. The force experienced by a charged particle in an electric field is given by the equation F = Q * E, where Q is the charge of the particle and E is the electric field strength.\n\n2. The acceleration of the particle can be found using Newton's second law, F = m * a, where m is the mass of the particle and a is the acceleration.\n\n3. Since the force on the particle due to the electric field is the only force acting on it, the acceleration of the particle is given by a = Q * E / m.\n\n4. The initial velocity of the particle is given as V, and the distance traveled by the particle is given as d.\n\n5. Using the equation of motion, d = V*t + (1/2)*a*t^2, where d is the distance traveled, V is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time taken to travel the distance d.\n\n6. Substituting the acceleration expression into the equation of motion, we get d = V*t + (1/2)*(Q*E/m)*t^2.\n\n7. If the initial velocity is doubled (2V) and the mass is halved (m/2), the new distance traveled by the particle can be calculated as follows:\n\n   d_new = 2V * t_new + (1/2) * (Q * E / (m/2)) * t_new^2\n         = 2V * t_new + 2 * (Q * E / m) * t_new^2.\n\n8. Since the initial and final distances traveled by the particle are the same, we can set the two expressions for d equal to each other:\n\n   V * t + (1/2) * (Q * E / m) * t^2 = 2V * t_new + 2 * (Q * E / m) * t_new^2.\n\n9.

Substituting t = t_new into the above equation and simplifying, we get:\n\n   V * t + (1/2) * (Q * E / m) * t^2 = 2V * t + 2 * (Q * E / m) * t^2\n   0 = V * t + (3/2) * (Q * E / m) * t^2\n   t = 0.\n\n11.

            "solution": "The photoelectric effect occurs when photons of light are incident on a metal surface, causing electrons to be ejected from the surface. The energy of the photons must be greater than the work function of the metal in order for photoelectrons to be emitted.\n\nIn this case, it is observed that low-intensity visible light of wavelength 550 nm produced no photoelectrons. This suggests that the energy of the photons at this wavelength is not enough to overcome the work function of the metal.\n\nIf the intensity of the light is increased dramatically, the number of photons incident on the metal surface will increase. However, the energy of each individual photon will remain the same, since intensity only refers to the number of photons hitting the surface per unit time.\n\nTherefore, even with a dramatic increase in intensity, if the energy of each photon is still not enough to overcome the work function of the metal, no photoelectrons will be emitted.

            "question": "Which of the following correctly describes the motion of a real object in free fall? Assume that the object experiences drag force proportional to speed and that it strikes the ground before reaching terminal sped.",
            "solution": "To determine the correct description of the motion of a real object in free fall with drag force, we can break down the problem into steps:\n\n1. In free fall, an object initially accelerates downwards due to gravity with an acceleration of g = 9.8 m/s^2 (assuming no air resistance).\n2. However, in this case, the object experiences a drag force proportional to its speed, which opposes its motion. The drag force can be modeled by the equation F_drag = -bv, where b is the drag coefficient and v is the speed of the object.\n3. As the object accelerates downwards, the drag force will increase with speed and eventually balance out the gravitational force acting on the object.\n4. At this point, the object will reach its terminal velocity, where the net force on the object is zero and it no longer accelerates.\n5. However, since the object strikes the ground before reaching its terminal speed, it will not have a constant acceleration and its motion will be more complicated than simple free fall.\n6. The correct description of the motion of a real object in free fall with drag force is that it will initially accelerate downwards under the influence of gravity, but as it gains speed, the drag force will increase and eventually balance out the gravitational force, leading to a constant terminal velocity that the object will reach before hitting the ground."

The volume of a balloon is directly related to its circumference, so we will be looking at how the circumference cubed (C^3) changes with temperature.\n\nFirst, let's establish the relationship between volume and temperature. When a gas is heated, it expands and its volume increases. When a gas is cooled, it contracts and its volume decreases. Therefore, we can expect the volume (and thus the circumference) of the balloon to increase when heated and decrease when cooled.\n\nGiven that the circumference of the balloon is measured for three different conditions, we can assume that the circumference will be the largest in the warm oven, smaller at room temperature, and smallest in the freezer.\n\nTherefore, when we plot the circumference cubed (C^3) as a function of temperature T, we should expect to find a increasing trend - meaning that as the temperature increases, the circumference cubed will also increase.\n\nIn conclusion, a student plotting the circumference cubed as a function of temperature should expect to find a positive correlation between temperature and the circumference cubed, with the circumference cubed increasing as the temperature increases."

The electrostatic force between two charges q1 and q2 separated by a distance r is given by Coulomb's law:\n\nF_electrostatic = k * |q1*q2| / r^2, \n\nwhere k is the electrostatic constant. \n\nThe gravitational force between two masses m1 and m2 separated by a distance r is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation:\n\nF_gravity = G * |m1*m2| / r^2, \n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant. \n\nFor the net force to be 0 N, the electrostatic force must balance the gravitational force. Therefore, we have:\n\nk * |q1*q2| / r^2 = G * |m1*m2| / r^2. \n\nSince r^2 is positive and non-zero, we can cancel it from both sides:\n\nk * |q1*q2| = G * |m1*m2|. \n\nNow, the question asks us to determine which of the following is NOT true. \n\n1.

            "solution": "The correct statement concerning the motion of an ideal projectile launched at an angle of 45\u00b0 to the horizontal is that the horizontal range will be maximum.\n\nExplanation:\n1. The motion of a projectile can be broken down into horizontal and vertical components.\n2. When a projectile is launched at an angle of 45\u00b0 to the horizontal, the initial velocity will be evenly distributed between the horizontal and vertical components, with both components being the same.\n3. The time of flight and the maximum height reached by the projectile are dependent on the vertical component of velocity, while the horizontal range is dependent on the horizontal component.\n4. Since the horizontal component of velocity determines the horizontal range, launching the projectile at a 45\u00b0 angle will result in the maximum horizontal range because this angle maximizes the horizontal component of velocity.\n5. Therefore, the true statement concerning the motion of an ideal projectile launched at an angle of 45\u00b0 to the horizontal is that the horizontal range will be maximum."

            "solution": "Step 1: Let's denote the original force between the two balls as F. Therefore, F = 50 \u03bcN.\n\nStep 2: According to Coulomb's Law, the electric force between two charged objects is given by F = k * (q1 * q2) / r^2, where k is the electrostatic constant (8.99 x 10^9 Nm^2/C^2), q1 and q2 are the charges of the two objects, and r is the distance between the objects.\n\nStep 3: Since we are keeping the charges of the two balls the same, the charges q1 and q2 are constant. Therefore, the only variable that changes when we double the mass of one of the balls is the distance between the balls.\n\nStep 4: When the mass of one of the balls is doubled, the distance between the balls will also double. Therefore, the new distance between the balls is 2r.\n\nStep 5: Plugging in the new distance (2r) into Coulomb's Law formula, we get the new force F' as F' = k * (q1 * q2) / (2r)^2 = k * (q1 * q2) / 4r^2 = F / 4.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the new electric force between the balls when the mass of one of the balls is doubled is 1/4th of the original force. Therefore, the new electric force is 50 \u03bcN / 4 = 12.5 \u03bcN. \n\nStep 7: So, the new electric force between the balls is 12.5 \u03bcN."

Increase the area of the plates (A): By increasing the area of the plates that are parallel to each other, the capacitance of the capacitor will increase. This is because a larger area allows for more charges to be stored on the plates, thus increasing the capacitance.\n\n2.

            "question": "Two people, one of mass 100 kg and the other of mass 50 kg, stand facing each other on an ice-covered (essentially frictionless) pond. If the heavier person pushes on the lighter one with a force F, then",
            "solution": "1. First, we need to identify the forces acting on the two people. Since the ice-covered pond is frictionless, the only forces acting on the people are the force F exerted by the heavier person on the lighter person, and the equal and opposite reaction force exerted by the lighter person on the heavier person (Newton's third law).\n\n2. We can set up the equation of motion for both people based on Newton's second law, F = ma, where F is the net force acting on the person, m is the mass of the person, and a is the acceleration of the person.\n\nFor the heavier person with mass 100 kg:\nF - F_reaction = m*a\nF - F_reaction = 100*a\n\nFor the lighter person with mass 50 kg:\nF_reaction - F = m*a\nF_reaction - F = 50*a\n\n3. Since the two people are essentially connected and move together, they will have the same acceleration, a. This means that we can set the two equations equal to each other:\n100*a - F_reaction = 50*a - F\n100*a - 50*a = F_reaction - F\n50*a = F_reaction - F\n\n4. Now, we can substitute the expression for the reaction force, F_reaction, from the second equation:\n50*a = (F + F)\n50*a = 2F\na = 2F / 50\na = F / 25\n\n5. So, the acceleration of the two people is equal to F divided by 25. This means that the heavier person will accelerate at a rate of F/100, and the lighter person will accelerate at a rate of F/50 in the opposite direction.\n\nThis is the solution to the given physics problem."

This force is responsible for keeping the atoms and molecules in the tabletop and the wooden block from passing through each other.\n\n1. At a microscopic level, the atoms and molecules in the tabletop and the wooden block are made up of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons.\n\n2. When the wooden block is placed on the tabletop, the electrons in the atoms of the tabletop and the wooden block repel each other due to their like charges, creating a force that pushes back against the force of gravity pulling the block downwards.\n\n3. This electromagnetic force between the electrons in the atoms of the tabletop and the wooden block creates a stable equilibrium, where the block is held in place on the tabletop.\n\n4. Without this electromagnetic force, the wooden block would fall through the tabletop due to the force of gravity acting upon it.\n\nIn conclusion, the electromagnetic force is responsible for the interaction between the wooden block and the tabletop, allowing the block to be supported and stay in place."

Which of the following is a reasonable explanation for this phenomenon?",
            "solution": "The most reasonable explanation for this phenomenon is that the potential energy stored in the rubber band is not consistent in each trial. As the rubber band winds and unwinds around the axle, it stores potential energy. When the toy is given a shove, the rubber band will release this potential energy as the cart moves up the ramp. However, if the rubber band does not wind or unwind consistently in each trial, then the amount of potential energy stored will vary. This would result in the cart reaching different heights on the ramp in each trial, even though the kinetic energy given to the cart remains the same each time. So, the inconsistent winding and unwinding of the rubber band is likely causing the toy to reach different heights on the ramp in different trials."

            "solution": "The centripetal force that keeps the car in circular motion is provided by the friction force between the tires and the road. \n\nStep 1: Draw a free body diagram of the forces acting on the car as it rounds the banked curve. Label the forces: the friction force (F_friction), the normal force (F_normal), and the weight of the car (mg).\n\nStep 2: Resolve the weight of the car into its components. The weight of the car can be broken down into two components: one perpendicular to the road (mgcos\u03b8) and one parallel to the road (mgsin\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle of the banked curve.\n\nStep 3: The normal force from the road acts perpendicular to the road and balances the perpendicular component of the weight of the car. Therefore, F_normal = mgcos\u03b8.\n\nStep 4: The friction force between the tires and the road acts parallel to the road and provides the centripetal force required to keep the car in circular motion. Therefore, F_friction = mgsin\u03b8.\n\nStep 5: The centripetal force needed to keep the car in circular motion is given by the equation F_centripetal = m*v^2 / r, where m is the mass of the car, v is the speed of the car, and r is the radius of the curve.\n\nStep 6: Since the friction force provides the centripetal force, we can set F_friction equal to the centripetal force: mgsin\u03b8 = m*v^2 / r.\n\nStep 7: Simplify the equation to solve for the speed of the car: v = sqrt(r * g * sin\u03b8), where g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nTherefore, the friction force between the tires and the road provides the centripetal force that keeps the car in circular motion."

The formula for vertical displacement under gravity is given by: \nVertical displacement = 0.5 x g x t^2, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2) and t is the time (4 s).\n\nVertical displacement = 0.5 x 9.8 m/s^2 x (4 s)^2 = 78.4 meters.\n\nStep 3: Use Pythagorean theorem to find the total speed of the stone when it enters the water.\n\nThe total speed of the stone can be calculated as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with legs representing the horizontal distance traveled (120 meters) and the vertical displacement (78.4 meters).\n\nTotal speed = square root of (horizontal distance^2 + vertical displacement^2)\nTotal speed = square root of (120^2 + 78.4^2)\nTotal speed = square root of (14400 + 6145.6)\nTotal speed = square root of 20545.6\nTotal speed \u2248 143.4 m/s.\n\nTherefore, the stone's total speed when it enters the water 4 seconds later is approximately 143.4 m/s."

            "solution": "When a beam of monochromatic light enters a glass window pane from air, it will experience a change in speed and direction. This is due to the difference in the refractive indices of air and glass.\n\nStep 1: The beam of light will slow down as it enters the glass since light travels slower in a medium with a higher refractive index.\n\nStep 2: The change in speed causes the light to bend, or refract, towards the normal line (an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface of the glass at the point of entry). This is known as refraction.\n\nStep 3: The amount of bending, or the angle of refraction, is determined by Snell's Law, which states: \nn1 * sin\u03b81 = n2 * sin\u03b82\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the initial and final mediums, and \u03b81 and \u03b82 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nStep 4: The refractive index of air is approximately 1.00 and the refractive index of glass is typically around 1.5. Therefore, the angle of refraction will be less than the angle of incidence.\n\nStep 5: As the light beam exits the glass window pane back into the air, it will once again experience a change in speed and direction. This time, the light will speed up and bend away from the normal.\n\nIn conclusion, when a beam of monochromatic light enters a glass window pane from the air, it will experience a change in speed and direction due to the phenomenon of refraction."

This can be observed by a decrease in the wave's intensity or loudness as it reaches the child, indicating that the wave has lost energy along the way.\n\nBy considering these observations, it can be concluded that the portion of the wave hitting the child's ankles carries less energy than the wave did when it was first created by the rock's impact."

            "question": "Physics students are checking the constant acceleration equations of kinematics by measuring the velocity of a tennis ball that is dropped and falls 6 meters and then passes through a photogate. The predicted velocity is 20% above the velocity measured by the photogate. Which of the following best describes the cause of the large percent difference?",
            "solution": "Step 1: We know that the acceleration due to gravity is a constant value of approximately 9.8 m/s^2.\n\nStep 2: Using the kinematic equation, we can calculate the predicted velocity of the tennis ball when it reaches the photogate after falling 6 meters. The equation we will use is:\n\nvf^2 = vi^2 + 2ad\n\nWhere:\nvf = final velocity (unknown)\nvi = initial velocity (0 m/s since the ball was dropped)\na = acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2)\nd = distance (6 meters)\n\nBy plugging in the values, we get:\n\nvf^2 = 0 + 2(9.8)(6)\nvf^2 = 0 + 117.6\nvf = \u221a117.6\nvf \u2248 10.84 m/s\n\nStep 3: The predicted velocity is stated to be 20% above the velocity measured by the photogate. Therefore, the actual measured velocity by the photogate is:\n\nMeasured velocity = 1.20 * 10.84\nMeasured velocity \u2248 13.01 m/s\n\nStep 4: The cause of the large percent difference between the predicted velocity and the measured velocity could be due to air resistance. As the tennis ball falls, it experiences air resistance which can slow down its acceleration and reduce its velocity as compared to the theoretical value without considering air resistance. This discrepancy is often seen in real-world experiments where factors such as friction or air resistance can impact the motion of objects."

            "question": "Mercury orbits the sun in about one-fifth of an Earth year. If 1 AU is defined as the distance from the Earth to the sun, what is the approximate distance between Mercury and the sun?",
            "solution": "Step 1: Calculate the orbital period of Mercury\nGiven that Mercury orbits the sun in about one-fifth of an Earth year, we can calculate the orbital period of Mercury in years:\nOrbital period of Mercury = 1/5 Earth year = 1/5 * 365.25 days (average length of an Earth year) = 73.05 days\n\nStep 2: Calculate the distance between Mercury and the sun\nUsing Kepler's third law of planetary motion, we can relate the orbital period of a planet to its distance from the sun. The formula is:\nT^2 = (4\u03c0^2/GM) * r^3\n\nWhere:\nT = orbital period of the planet in years\nG = gravitational constant (6.674 \u00d7 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)\nM = mass of the sun (1.989 \u00d7 10^30 kg)\nr = distance of the planet from the sun in meters\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for r:\nr = (T^2 * GM)/(4\u03c0^2)\n\nSubstitute the values of T, G, and M into the formula:\nr = (73.05^2 * 6.674 \u00d7 10^-11 * 1.989 \u00d7 10^30)/(4\u03c0^2)\nr = 4.544 \u00d7 10^12 meters\n\nStep 3: Convert the distance to Astronomical Units (AU)\nSince 1 AU is defined as the distance from the Earth to the sun (approximately 1.496 \u00d7 10^11 meters), we can convert the distance in meters to AU:\nDistance in AU = 4.544 \u00d7 10^12 meters / 1.496 \u00d7 10^11 meters/AU\nDistance in AU = 30.34 AU\n\nTherefore, the approximate distance between Mercury and the sun is approximately 30.34 AU."

            "question": "The Gravitron is a carnival ride that looks like a large cylinder. People stand inside the cylinder against the wall as it begins to spin. Eventually, it is rotating fast enough that the floor can be removed without anyone falling. Given then the coefficient of friction between a person\u2019s clothing and the wall is \u03bc, the tangential speed is v, and the radius of the ride is R, what is greatest mass that a person can be to safely go on this ride?",
            "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the forces acting on the person standing inside the Gravitron. \n\n1. The centripetal force required to keep the person moving in a circular path is provided by the frictional force between the person's clothing and the wall. The maximum frictional force can be calculated using the equation Ffriction = \u03bc * Fnormal, where Fnormal is the normal force acting on the person. In this case, the normal force is equal to the gravitational force acting on the person, which can be calculated as Fnormal = mg, where m is the mass of the person and g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2).\n\n2. The centripetal force required is given by the equation F = m * (v^2 / R), where m is the mass of the person, v is the tangential speed, and R is the radius of the ride.\n\n3. Since the frictional force is providing the centripetal force, we can set Ffriction = F to find the maximum mass that a person can be. \n   \u03bc * mg = m * (v^2 / R)\n   \u03bc * g = v^2 / R\n   m = \u03bc * g * R / v^2\n\n4. Therefore, the greatest mass that a person can safely have on the ride is given by the formula m = \u03bc * g * R / v^2."

            "question": "An artificial satellite orbits Earth just above the atmosphere in a circle with constant speed. A small meteor collides with the satellite at point P in its orbit, increasing its speed by 1%, but not changing the instantaneous direction of the satellite\u2019s velocity. Which of the following describes the satellite\u2019s new orbit?",
            "solution": "1. The initial orbit of the satellite can be considered as a circular orbit before the collision.\n2. Since the speed of the satellite increases by 1% after the collision, the new orbit is also a circular orbit with a larger radius compared to the initial orbit.\n3. The increase in speed will result in the satellite moving to a higher orbit to maintain gravitational equilibrium.\n4. The new orbit will have a larger radius and a higher altitude compared to the initial orbit.\n5. The direction of the satellite's velocity remains the same after the collision, so the orbit is still circular but with a larger radius.\n6. Therefore, the satellite's new orbit is a circular orbit with a larger radius and altitude compared to the initial orbit."
