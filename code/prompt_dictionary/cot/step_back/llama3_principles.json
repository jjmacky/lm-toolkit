For a diverging mirror, the focal length is negative.\n   A negative focal length indicates that the mirror diverges light rays, which means the image appears on the same side as the object.\n\n4. **Thin Lens Equation**: Although this problem involves a flat mirror rather than a lens, understanding the thin lens equation can help with setting up the problem:\n   1/do + 1/di = (n-1)(1/f)\n   where n is the refractive index of the medium (usually air or vacuum).\n\n5. **Image Formation**: The principles of image formation are crucial in optics problems.
