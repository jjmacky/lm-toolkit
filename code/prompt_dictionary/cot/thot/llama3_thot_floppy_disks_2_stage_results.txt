Final answer for summary response 6:
According to Step 5: Stopping Physical Media Requirements, the Japanese government stopped requiring physical media (like floppy disks) for 1,900 types of submissions two years prior to June 28, 2024. To find the year, we need to subtract 2 from 2024:

2024 - 2 = 2022

Therefore, the Japanese government stopped requiring physical media for business filings and citizen submission forms in the year 2022.

Final answer for summary response 7:
According to Step 4 of the analysis, the Japanese government stopped requiring physical media (like floppy disks) for 1,900 types of submissions two years before eliminating floppy disks altogether. Since they eliminated floppy disks by June 28, 2024, we can calculate the year when they stopped requiring physical media as follows:

Elimination date: June 28, 2024
Timeframe before elimination: 2 years

Let's subtract 2 from the elimination date to get:

June 28, 2024 - 2 = April 26, 2022

So, the Japanese government stopped requiring physical media for business filings and citizen submission forms by April 26, 2022.



---------
Final answer for summary response 8:
According to Step 5, the Japanese government stopped requiring physical media (floppy disks) for 1,900 types of submissions two years prior to eliminating their use altogether. Since the complete elimination was on June 28, 2024, we can calculate that:

2 years before June 28, 2024 = June 28, 2022

So, the Japanese government stopped requiring physical media for business filings and citizen submission forms in **2022**.
