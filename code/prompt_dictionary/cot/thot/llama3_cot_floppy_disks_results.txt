Response 1:
Let's break it down!

We know that the government stopped requiring physical media for 1,900 types of submissions "two years before the complete elimination of floppy disks".

Since the government completely eliminated floppy disks in all its systems except one environmental regulation as of June 28, 2024, we can infer that they stopped requiring physical media for these 1,900 types of submissions two years prior to that.

So, if we subtract two years from June 28, 2024, we get:

June 28, 2022

That's when the government stopped requiring physical media for business filings and citizen submission forms!

Response 2:
A nice puzzle! Let's break it down:

1. We know that the government stopped requiring physical media (floppy disks) for 1,900 types of submissions "two years before" they eliminated floppy disks completely.
2. This event happened on June 28, 2024, when Japan's government eliminated floppy disks in all its systems, except for one environmental regulation.

So, if we subtract 2 years from June 28, 2024, we get:

June 28, 2022

This is the year when the Japanese government stopped requiring physical media (floppy disks) for business filings and citizen submission forms.

Response 3:
Let's break it down:

* The government stopped requiring physical media (floppy disks) for 1,900 types of submissions "two years before the complete elimination of floppy disks".
* We know that the complete elimination of floppy disks happened on June 28, 2024.
* So, we can subtract two years from 2024 to find when the government stopped requiring physical media:

2024 - 2 = 2022

Therefore, the Japanese government stopped requiring physical media (floppy disks) for business filings and citizen submission forms in 2022.

Response 4:
Let's break it down step by step!

We know that the Japanese government eliminated the use of floppy disks in all its systems, except for one environmental regulation, as of June 28, 2024.

Two years before that (June 28, 2022), they stopped requiring physical media for 1,900 types of submissions. This implies that they stopped requiring physical media for those submissions sometime in June 2022.

Since we know the Japanese government declared a "war on floppy discs" about two years ago, which would be around June 2022 (since Taro Kono made this declaration about 2 years before the complete elimination of floppy disks), it's likely that they stopped requiring physical media for business filings and citizen submission forms sometime in June 2022.

So, to answer your question, the Japanese government stopped requiring physical media for business filings and citizen submission forms in around 2022.

Response 5:
A fun puzzle! Let's break it down:

1. The US Air Force stopped using 8-inch floppies in 2019.
2. Sony, the last company to manufacture floppy disks, stopped production in 2011.
3. Chuck E. Cheese was reported to be using floppy disks as recently as January 2023 (but this is not relevant to the Japanese government's decision).
4. Two years before the complete elimination of floppy disks, the government stopped requiring physical media for 1,900 types of submissions.

So, if we subtract 2 years from the time when all floppy disk use was eliminated (June 28, 2024), we get:

June 28, 2024 - 2 years = June 28, 2022

This is likely the year when the Japanese government stopped requiring physical media for business filings and citizen submission forms.

Am I correct?

Response 6:
A fun challenge!

Let's break it down:

* The government stopped requiring physical media (floppy disks) for 1,900 types of submissions "two years before the complete elimination of floppy disks".
* We know that the government completely eliminated floppy disks from all its systems as of June 28, 2024.
* To find the year when the government stopped requiring physical media, we need to subtract two years from 2024.

So... Japan's government stopped requiring physical media for business filings and citizen submission forms in **2022**.

Response 7:
A fun puzzle! Let's break it down:

1. The Digital Minister declared a "war on floppy discs" about two years ago, which means that was around 2 years before the complete elimination of floppy disks (assuming this is when the declaration was made).
2. We know that as of June 28, 2024, Japan's government eliminated the use of floppy disks in all its systems, except for one environmental regulation.
3. Two years before the complete elimination of floppy disks, the government stopped requiring physical media for 1,900 types of submissions.

Now, let's do some math:

* If we assume the declaration was made about 2 years before June 28, 2024, that would be around June 28, 2022.
* If the government stopped requiring physical media for 1,900 types of submissions two years before that, that would be around June 28, 2020.

So, based on this information, it appears that the Japanese government stopped requiring physical media for business filings and citizen submission forms in **2020**.

Response 8:
Let's break it down!

We know that Japan stopped requiring physical media (floppy disks) for 1,900 types of submissions two years before the complete elimination of floppy disks. We also know that the government eliminated the use of floppy disks in all its systems as of June 28, 2024.

So, to find when the Japanese government stopped requiring physical media, we can subtract two years from 2024:

2024 - 2 = 2022

Therefore, the Japanese government stopped requiring physical media for business filings and citizen submission forms in 2022.

Response 9:
A fun puzzle!

Let's break it down:

1. We know the Japanese government eliminated the use of floppy disks in all systems, except one environmental regulation, as of June 28, 2024.
2. Two years before that (2022), the government stopped requiring physical media for 1,900 types of submissions.

So, if we subtract 2 years from 2024, we get:

2024 - 2 = 2022

Therefore, the Japanese government stopped requiring physical media for business filings and citizen submission forms in **2022**.

Response 10:
A fun problem! Let's break it down:

1. Two years before the complete elimination of floppy disks, the government stopped requiring physical media for 1,900 types of submissions.
2. As of June 28, 2024, Japan's government eliminated the use of floppy disks in all its systems, except for one environmental regulation.

So, let's calculate:

June 28, 2024 - ? = ?

To find out when the government stopped requiring physical media for business filings and citizen submission forms, we need to subtract two years from June 28, 2024.

June 28, 2024 - 2 years = June 28, 2022

Therefore, in what year did the Japanese government stop requiring physical media for business filings and citizen submission forms?

The answer is: **2022**
