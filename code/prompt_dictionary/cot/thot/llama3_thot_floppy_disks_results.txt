Let's break down the information into manageable parts and summarize/analyze each section.

**Part 1: Japan's Digital Agency and floppy disk elimination**

The Japanese government established a Digital Agency to modernize its technology during the COVID-19 pandemic. This led to a "war on floppy disks" declaration by Digital Minister Taro Kono about two years ago (presumably around June 2022). The agency eliminated the use of floppy disks in all its systems, except for one environmental regulation, as of June 28, 2024.

**Analysis:** This part sets the stage for Japan's efforts to transition away from outdated technology. The declaration of a "war on floppy disks" suggests that the government is committed to making significant changes. The elimination of floppy disks in most systems by mid-2024 indicates progress towards modernization.

**Part 2: Physical media requirement stopped two years before elimination**

The government stopped requiring physical media for 1,900 types of submissions about two years before the complete elimination of floppy disks (presumably around June 2022). This means that Japan's government no longer requires physical media for most business filings and citizen submission forms.

**Analysis:** This part provides more context on the timeline of events. The fact that the government stopped requiring physical media for most submissions about two years before eliminating floppy disks suggests a phased approach to modernization, with an initial focus on digital submissions followed by the eventual elimination of floppy disk use.
