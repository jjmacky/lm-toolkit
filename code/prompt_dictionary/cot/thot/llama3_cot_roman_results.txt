A nice historical puzzle! Let's break it down:

1. The last Western Roman Emperor was deposed in 476 CE.
2. Romulus Augustulus began his reign as Western Roman Emperor in 475 CE, and ruled from the city of Ravenna until his deposition (in 476 CE).
3. Odoacer, a Germanic chieftain, took control of Italy in 476 CE, which means he was the one who deposed Romulus Augustulus.
4. Therefore, Odoacer was the leader of the group that conquered the city where the last Western Roman Emperor ruled (Ravenna).

So, the answer is: Odoacer!

Response 2:
Let's work backwards to find out who was the leader of the group that conquered the city where the last Western Roman Emperor ruled.

We know that Romulus Augustulus, the last Western Roman Emperor, was deposed in 476 CE. We also know that he ruled from Ravenna, which became the capital of the Western Roman Empire in 402 CE.

In 476 CE, Odoacer, a Germanic chieftain, took control of Italy. So, it's likely that Odoacer is the leader who conquered Ravenna and deposed Romulus Augustulus.

Am I correct?

A nice history puzzle! Let's break it down:

1. The last Western Roman Emperor was deposed in 476 CE.
2. Odoacer, a Germanic chieftain, took control of Italy in 476 CE.
3. Romulus Augustulus began his reign as Western Roman Emperor in 475 CE.

So, Romulus Augustulus was the last Western Roman Emperor. He ruled from Ravenna until he was deposed.

4. The city of Ravenna became the capital of the Western Roman Empire in 402 CE.

That means that by the time Romulus Augustulus took over, Ravenna had already been the capital for over 70 years!

Now, let's fast-forward to who conquered Ravenna:

5. Odoacer defeated Theoderic the Great in 493 CE.
6. Odoacer was the one who took control of Italy in 476 CE.

So, it looks like Odoacer is the leader of the group that conquered the city where Romulus Augustulus ruled (Ravenna).

Response 4:
A fun historical puzzle!

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Romulus Augustulus began his reign as Western Roman Emperor in 475 CE.
2. The last Western Roman Emperor was deposed in 476 CE, which means Romulus Augustulus' reign did not end with the deposition (he must have been deposed later than 476 CE).
3. The last Western Roman Emperor was deposed in 476 CE. This event occurred before Romulus Augustulus' deposition.
4. Odoacer took control of Italy in 476 CE, which means he was likely the one who deposed the last Western Roman Emperor.

So, the leader of the group that conquered the city where the last Western Roman Emperor ruled (Ravenna) was... Odoacer!

Am I correct?

A nice historical puzzle!

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The last Western Roman Emperor was deposed in 476 CE.
2. Romulus Augustulus began his reign as Western Roman Emperor in 475 CE, which means he ruled for only one year before being deposed.
3. The last Western Roman Emperor was deposed in 476 CE, so this is the event we're looking for.
4. Odoacer took control of Italy in 476 CE, and since the last Western Roman Emperor was deposed that same year, it's likely that Odoacer is the leader who conquered the city where the last Western Roman Emperor ruled.

So, the answer is: Odoacer, a Germanic chieftain.

Response 6:
Let's break it down together!

We know that the last Western Roman Emperor was deposed in 476 CE, and Romulus Augustulus ruled from Ravenna until his deposition.

So, the leader of the group that conquered the city where the last Western Roman Emperor ruled (Ravenna) is... Odoacer!

2. Romulus Augustulus began his reign as Western Roman Emperor in 475 CE, and he ruled from Ravenna until his deposition.

That's Odoacer, a Germanic chieftain!

A fun historical puzzle! Let's break it down step by step:

1. The last Western Roman Emperor was deposed in 476 CE, and he ruled from Ravenna.
2. Romulus Augustulus began his reign as Western Roman Emperor in 475 CE, which means that the previous emperor must have been deposed in 476 CE (since Romulus Augustulus didn't start until a year later).
3. Odoacer, a Germanic chieftain, took control of Italy in 476 CE, which means he was likely the one who deposed the last Western Roman Emperor.
4. The leader of the group that conquered Ravenna and deposed the last Western Roman Emperor is therefore Odoacer.

So, the answer is: Odoacer!

Let's break it down!

We know that the last Western Roman Emperor was deposed in 476 CE, and Romulus Augustulus ruled from Ravenna until his deposition. So, the leader of the group that conquered the city where the last Western Roman Emperor ruled (Ravenna) is likely to be Odoacer, a Germanic chieftain who took control of Italy in 476 CE.

Odoacer didn't exactly conquer Romulus Augustulus himself, but he did take control of Italy, which implies that he may have had some role in the deposition of the last Western Roman Emperor.

A nice historical puzzle! Let's break it down step by step.

1. The last Western Roman Emperor was deposed in 476 CE.
2. Odoacer, a Germanic chieftain, took control of Italy in 476 CE.
3. Romulus Augustulus began his reign as Western Roman Emperor in 475 CE (just before the deposition).
4. Romulus Augustulus ruled from the city of Ravenna until his deposition.

So, the leader of the group that conquered the city where the last Western Roman Emperor ruled is... Odoacer! He took control of Italy and deposed the last Western Roman Emperor in 476 CE, which means he conquered the city of Ravenna.
