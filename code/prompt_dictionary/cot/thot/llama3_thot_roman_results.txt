Let's break down the information into smaller chunks and analyze each part step by step.

**Part 1: Early History**

First, let's look at Julius Caesar crossing the Rubicon river in 49 BCE, which sparked a civil war. This event is significant because it marks the beginning of Caesar's rise to power and sets the stage for the Roman Empire.

**Summary:** Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon river in 49 BCE, starting a civil war that would lead to his eventual rise to power.

**Part 2: Western Roman Empire**

Next, we learn that Ravenna became the capital of the Western Roman Empire in 402 CE. This is important because it tells us when the Western Roman Empire was established and where its capital was located.

**Summary:** The city of Ravenna became the capital of the Western Roman Empire in 402 CE.

**Part 3: Rise and Fall of Western Roman Emperor**

Now, let's examine Romulus Augustulus' reign as Western Roman Emperor. He began his rule in 475 CE, but was eventually deposed. We also know that the last Western Roman Emperor was deposed in 476 CE, which implies that Romulus Augustulus was the last emperor.

**Summary:** Romulus Augustulus ruled as Western Roman Emperor from 475 CE until his deposition, and he was the last Western Roman Emperor to be deposed in 476 CE.

**Part 4: Conquest of Italy**

Next, we learn that Odoacer, a Germanic chieftain, took control of Italy in 476 CE. This is significant because it marks the end of the Western Roman Empire and the beginning of a new era in Italian history.

**Summary:** Odoacer, a Germanic chieftain, took control of Italy in 476 CE, effectively ending the Western Roman Empire.

**Part 5: Conquest of Rome**

We also know that the Visigoths sacked Rome in 410 CE under the leadership of Alaric I. This event is significant because it shows that the Western Roman Empire was vulnerable to attack and that external forces could penetrate its borders.

**Summary:** The Visigoths, led by Alaric I, sacked Rome in 410 CE, demonstrating the vulnerability of the Western Roman Empire to external threats.

**Part 6: Conquest of Carthage**

Finally, we learn that the Vandals captured the city of Carthage in 439 CE. This event is significant because it shows that the Western Roman Empire was also vulnerable to attack from within its own borders, as internal conflicts could weaken its defenses.

**Summary:** The Vandals captured the city of Carthage in 439 CE, highlighting the vulnerability of the Western Roman Empire to internal conflicts and external threats.

Now that we've broken down each part step by step, let's analyze the information as a whole. It appears that the leader of the group that conquered the city where the last Western Roman Emperor ruled was Odoacer, a Germanic chieftain who took control of Italy in 476 CE and effectively ended the Western Roman Empire.

Response 7:
Let's break down the information step by step to identify who led the group that conquered the city where the last Western Roman Emperor ruled.

Step 1: Identify the capital of the Western Roman Empire
According to the text, Ravenna became the capital of the Western Roman Empire in 402 CE. This is important because we know that Romulus Augustulus, the last Western Roman Emperor, ruled from Ravenna until his deposition.

Step 2: Determine when the last Western Roman Emperor was deposed
The text states that the last Western Roman Emperor was deposed in 476 CE. This means that Romulus Augustulus must have been ruling at this time.

Step 3: Identify who took control of Italy after the last Western Roman Emperor's deposition
According to the text, Odoacer, a Germanic chieftain, took control of Italy in 476 CE, which is around the same time as the last Western Roman Emperor's deposition. This suggests that Odoacer may have been involved in the deposition or played a significant role.

Step 4: Analyze who defeated Odoacer
The text states that Theoderic the Great, an Ostrogothic king, defeated Odoacer in 493 CE. This indicates that Theoderic the Great was likely to be the leader of the group that conquered the city where Romulus Augustulus ruled.

Step 5: Confirm the leader's identity
Given that Ravenna is the capital of the Western Roman Empire and Romulus Augustulus was ruling there, it seems reasonable to conclude that Theoderic the Great led the Ostrogoths in conquering Ravenna.

Let's break down the information into manageable parts and analyze it step by step.

**Part 1: Background**

* Ravenna becomes the capital of the Western Roman Empire in 402 CE.
* Julius Caesar crosses the Rubicon river in 49 BCE, sparking a civil war.
* Romulus Augustulus begins his reign as Western Roman Emperor in 475 CE.

Summary: We're introduced to the city of Ravenna, which will play a significant role later. We also learn that Julius Caesar's actions led to a civil war, and that Romulus Augustulus is a Western Roman Emperor who started ruling in 475 CE.

Analysis: So far, we have some historical context about Italy, Rome, and the Roman Empire. The dates are important, as they will help us understand the timeline of events. Julius Caesar's actions sparked a civil war, which might have led to changes in the empire's structure or power dynamics.

**Part 2: Conquest of Rome and Fall of Western Roman Empire**

* The Visigoths sack Rome in 410 CE under the leadership of Alaric I.
* The last Western Roman Emperor is deposed in 476 CE.
* Odoacer, a Germanic chieftain, takes control of Italy in 476 CE.

Summary: We learn that the Visigoths conquered Rome in 410 CE and that the Western Roman Empire collapsed with the deposition of its last emperor in 476 CE. Odoacer, a Germanic leader, then took control of Italy.

Analysis: This part is significant because it shows the decline and fall of the Western Roman Empire. The Visigoths' conquest of Rome marked a turning point, and by 476 CE, the empire had effectively ceased to exist. Odoacer's takeover of Italy indicates that he was one of the leaders who filled the power vacuum left behind.

**Part 3: Leadership after Fall of Western Roman Empire**

* Romulus Augustulus ruled from the city of Ravenna until his deposition.
* The Ostrogothic king Theoderic the Great defeats Odoacer in 493 CE.

Summary: We learn that Romulus Augustulus, the last Western Roman Emperor, was deposed and that Theoderic the Great, an Ostrogothic king, defeated Odoacer in 493 CE.

Analysis: This part shows who took control after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Romulus Augustulus's deposition indicates that there were likely power struggles or rival claimants to the throne. The defeat of Odoacer by Theoderic the Great suggests that Theoderic became a dominant force in Italy.

**Conclusion**

We've walked through the context step by step, summarizing and analyzing as we go. We learned about the city of Ravenna, the fall of the Western Roman Empire, and the leadership that followed its collapse.

**Step 1: Establishing the timeline**

We know that:

* Romulus Augustulus began his reign as Western Roman Emperor in 475 CE.
* The last Western Roman Emperor was deposed in 476 CE.
* Odoacer took control of Italy in 476 CE, which suggests that this is when the Western Roman Empire came to an end.

So, we have a timeline: Romulus Augustulas ruled from 475-476 CE, and then he was deposed. Odoacer took over after that.

**Step 2: The context of Ravenna**

We learn that:

* In 402 CE, the city of Ravenna became the capital of the Western Roman Empire.
* Romulus Augustulas ruled from the city of Ravenna until his deposition.

This tells us that Ravenna was an important location during the Western Roman Empire's final years. It was the capital, and it's where the last Western Roman Emperor ruled before being deposed.

**Step 3: The fall of the Western Roman Empire**

We know that:

* Odoacer took control of Italy in 476 CE.
* This is when the last Western Roman Emperor was deposed.

Putting these pieces together, we can conclude that Odoacer was likely the leader who conquered the city where the last Western Roman Emperor ruled (Ravenna). He took over Italy in 476 CE, which marks the end of the Western Roman Empire.
