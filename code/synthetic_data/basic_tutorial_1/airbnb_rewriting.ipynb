    "# Creating Synthetic Apartment Reviews Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll create some basic synthetic data as an exercise in prompt engineering. The goal is to create a set of realistic apartment reviews (unstructured text) that contain the monthly price paid for the apartment. We'll use the review to populate a JSON object which includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The review\n",
    "- A natural language query requesting an extraction of the monthly rent price from the review\n",
    "- A JSON schema corresponding to that query\n",
    "- A JSON object which matches the schema and contains the rent price (can be used as a target for benchmarking or finetuning)\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we'll take the creative approach of using a large language model to translate short-term Airbnb rental reviews into long-term apartment reviews that contain monthly pricing information from the reviewer. This exercise is based on a real-world use case. I was surprised when I searched online for apartment review datasets, but was unable to find many. One way to solve this problem would be to scrape apartment rental reviews from the web, but creating synthetic data allows us to have more control over the output. Another approach is to simply ask a language model to generate a fictional reviews. However, in my experience seeding the model with a real review generates richer and more varied synthetic data. The approach used here can be extended in many ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the dataset contains both the unstructured text as well as the target output, this kind of synthetic data can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To create a data extraction benchmark to evaluate a large language model or other machine learning model.\n",
    "- To fine-tune a smaller language model on data extraction activities.\n",
    "- For educational purposes, if you want to create curated dataset of unstructured text to help teach students.\n",
    "- To create information-dense text that might more efficiently train a large language model.\n",

    "### Generating the synthetic data\n",
    "Now let's generate our synthetic data. I started by sampling a few random rows from the dataset and selected three Airbnb reviews. I then rewrote these reviews to reflect long-term apartment rental experiences rather than short-term Airbnb stays. Initially, I used ChatGPT to assist with this task, but it struggled to produce realistic reviews until I added specific instructions and provided examples. For instance, it would use phrases like \"When we first checked in,\" which are not typical in apartment reviews. After several iterations of refining the instructions and examples, I developed a prompt that works quite well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I created a function to generate rent prices. The function samples from a normal distribution but ensures the final digit matches the step size ($5 in my code) to more realistically reflect rental prices. Alternatively, you could generate prices using a straightforward method, such as sampling from a uniform distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "`rent_prices = random.sample(range(1000, 6000, 5), n)`\n",
    "\n",
    "or from a normal distribution if you don't care about the rent prices having consistent final digits:\n",
    "\n",
    "`rent_prices = np.random.normal(2500, 1000, n)`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the language model inserts only the rent price into the review. However, you could extend this approach to insert multiple pieces of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "To increase the diversity in the synthetic dataset, I also introduced a step to replace \"Amsterdam\" if mentioned. It appears the original AirBnb dataset is from Amsterdam and this creates an unbalanced city distrubtion, even after having a language model rewrite the review. The logic selects a random city from a predefined list of well-known U.S. cities. Such a list is easy to create (ChatGPT printed out a list of 300 U.S. cities in a matter of seconds, which I copied and pasted into a text file). This approach enhances the variety of the synthetic data and makes it more representative of different rental markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed to the actual data generation, let's look at the resulting JSON object. The JSON object consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Review Text: The rewritten review reflecting a long-term apartment rental experience.\n",
    "2. Natural Language Query: A query matching the JSON schema. In this case the query is \"What was the rent price paid by this reviewer?\"\n",
    "3. JSON Schema: A schema I created for this activity, representing the structure we would want the model to follow for data extraction. This schema is not passed to the model but included in the final result for future benchmarking or fine-tuning.\n",
    "4. Rent Price: The rent price passed to the model and included in the review. The rent is allowed to be 'NA' in which case the rewritten review won't mention the rent price. This more realistically mimics the variety of real reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "json_object = {\n",
    "    \"review\": rewritten_review,\n",
    "    \"query\": \"What was the rent price paid by this reviewer?\",\n",

    "## Cost considerations\n",
    "In a production setting, cost is a crucial factor. There are several ways to reduce costs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using a Cheaper Model: Opting for a less expensive yet equally capable model can significantly cut costs. For example, Claude Sonnet 3.5 costs $3 per million input tokens compared to GPT-4o's $5 per million input tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using Open Source Models: Another approach is to use open-source models like Llama3. Although testing all open-source models is beyond the scope of this activity, I tested Llama3 (8B). While the results were good when the model returned a rewritten review, it was unreliable. Sometimes it returned the original review instead of the rewritten one, failed to incorporate the correct price, or added unnecessary leading or trailing explanatory text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Batch Processing: Requesting reviews in batches is another cost-saving measure. Although we still incur the input and output costs for each review, we save on the input cost of the long prompt instruction (approximately 650 words). The cost savings from this approach are calculated below:"
