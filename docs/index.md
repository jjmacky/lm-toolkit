# Welcome to The Prompt Dictionary!

Welcome to The Prompt Dictionary! This site aims to be a comprehensive repository of strategies designed to enhance interactions with large language model. It currently includes prompt techniques, with plans to expand to encompass prompt optimizations, evaluations, benchmarks, and related topics such as synthetic data. I update this repository frequently to keep pace with rapid advancements, though there's often a backlog of new strategies to add. This archive captures each strategy at a specific point in time, acknowledging that some may become less relevant over time as language models evolve.

The goal of The Prompt Dictionary is to serve as a historical record, documenting the evolution, benefits, and limitations of various prompting techniques. While some practical tutorials and examples are included, the primary function of this dictionary is to provide authoritative, reference-style information on prompt techniques and related practical applications. It functions similarly to a dictionary in the technical domain, offering definitions, usage examples, and specific guidelines, rather than comprehensive theoretical discussions or extended instructional content found in courses or manuals. Each entry provides:

- Background on the prompting strategy
- When to use it
- What to know about its history
- Best practices
- What to watch out for
- A link to the original source
- Prompting examples
- Code implementation for API calls

Many of the techniques featured here I first saw in the wonderful, "The Prompt Report: A Systematic Survey of Prompting Techniques" ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06608)).
