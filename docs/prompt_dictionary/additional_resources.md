## Prompting resources

1. Many of the techniques featured in the Prompt Dictionary I first saw in the wonderful, "The Prompt Report: A Systematic Survey of Prompting Techniques" ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06608)).
2. For courses and advice on practical prompting check out [LearnPrompting.org](https://learnprompting.org/).
3. Check out Anthropic's [guide to prompt engineering](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview) and their [prompt library](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/prompt-library/library).
4. OpenAI also has a [prompt engineering guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) and detailed [API examples](https://platform.openai.com/docs/examples/default-grammar).
